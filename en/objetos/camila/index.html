      <main><p>Camila is more than an object; it's an almost human presence, the fruit of a deeply personal creation, inspired by the need to communicate the difficulty of establishing and maintaining contact for those living with shyness or social anxiety.</p>
<p>Although in its final version the interaction has been simplified - it touches in the presence of people and stops in their absence - the initial concept was more complex:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once switched on, Camila would start her melody extremely slowly. When someone approached at a certain distance, she would stop immediately. However, if she &quot;felt at ease&quot; again, she would resume the melody at a faster pace and gain &quot;stamina&quot;, allowing her to get closer. After a few cycles of approaching, retreating, getting used to it and starting again, it was possible to pick up the music box and walk freely around the room while it played its melody at full speed, in complete confidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This project reflects the importance of respecting the limits of those who are vulnerable, but also of encouraging a gradual vulnerabilisation that allows deeper bonds to be created.</p>
<p>Camila made her debut in 2022 in an immersive training course for the <a class="text-link" href="https://musicateatral.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://musicateatral.com/">Companhia de Música Teatral</a>, in Loulé, and was later incorporated into the show Canção da Terra, from which the photo above was taken, with permission from the Companhia de Música Teatral.</p>
