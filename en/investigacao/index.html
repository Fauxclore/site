<p><em>On this page you'll find some of my scientific publications, mostly about community art projects and transdisciplinary shows developed during the COVID-19 pandemic.</em></p>
<h3>Projecto X: A Journey Inside Ourselves and What We Found When We Arrived</h3>
<p>Description of the methods, difficulties and results of a community project in Aveiro. It involved artists and students from the Music course at the University of Aveiro, as well as people from the Aveiro Parents Network Association.</p>

<h3>Música na comunidade em Portugal (1980-2021): Prática versus disseminação </h3>
<p>Reflection on the apparent discrepancy between the reported number of Community Music projects in Portugal and the academic writing about them. It contains slightly outdated data, the most up-to-date version of which can be found below in my doctoral thesis..</p>

<h3>Syncretic Musical Experiments #19: developing a live performance during a pandemic </h3>
<p>This multi-handed article reflects on the difficulties and strategies encountered in developing a stage show in the midst of COVID-19. Along the way, there is a history of other intermediate projects that allowed us to acquire the skills to develop what I consider to be the best project I have ever taken part in.</p>

<h3>Constraints and creativity: Transforming a live artistic experience for children into Zoom </h3>
<p>Still on the theme of &quot;the impact of COVID-19&quot;, this article reflects on the process of adapting what was previously an interactive outreach performance with children to an online format, equally interactive, but using the Zoom platform..</p>

<h3>Video-based categorization system and frequency analysis of gestures in saxophone playing </h3>

<h3>Música e Comunidade: Música na Comunidade em Portugal e no Ensino Artístico </h3>
<p>Doctoral thesis and the result of several years of hard but edifying work. A macroscopic reflection on the phenomenon of Community Music in Portugal: its history, its characteristics, its future. Along the way, I tried to reflect on possible intersections between this practice and Specialised Artistic Education. It has an eternally incomplete survey of all visible Community Music projects. It has some pieces of writing that I consider to be the best I've written so far.</p>
