      <h1>Technologies for and in creation</h1>
      <h6>5 de agosto de 2025</h6>
       
      <main><p>I have repeatedly been confronted with the effects of technology use in musical practice. By this, I mean musical practice by lay people, using sound objects created by me.</p>
<p>Firstly, I am concerned about the relationship between users (let's call them “amateur artists”) and the objects. In an interaction with an object like the <a class="text-link" href="/en/objetos/alfabetario/index.html">Alfabetário</a>, the first thing I notice is the disconnection between the user typing on a keyboard and the result of their typing. In a way, the continuity between input (text) and output (image) is broken when the user presses ENTER. At that moment, the present physical act of pressing the loud, heavy keys on a keyboard transfigures and leaves its immediate sensory notion, and what appears projected on the screen could either be something generated beforehand or the effect of writing it.</p>

</figure>
<p>On the other hand, the object itself implies a prior explanation, because as it needs to be activated and doesn't offer feedback while typing, it becomes incomprehensible. &quot;Of all the possible interactions, why have I chosen this one?&quot; thinks the user.</p>
<p>This is the question that prompted this post. In what way is technology more of a detractor of interaction than an amplifier of it?</p>
<p>This question is undoubtedly biased by my own personal practice, by my demons and torments. My constant anguish and indecision about whether I'm eternally in love with technology and what it can do for us, or whether I'm trapped in the dream of returning to the countryside and living in the idyllic, analogue peace of nature. Of course, this is just a false dichotomy; it's in the midst of all this indecision that I should aim my focus.</p>
