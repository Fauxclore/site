      <h1>Imaginary Birds</h1>

      <main><p>Imaginary Birds are one of the few bird species that are not endangered. They exist in the realm of the imagination, just like their digital cousins, the CyberBirds, created by mankind with the aid of technology. Imaginary Birds are born from people's fertile imaginations, with a simple goal - to facilitate a deeper connection between humans and real birds. Sometimes they fly alone, their songs weaving unexpected harmonies in the air. At other times, however, they rely on the accompaniment of human voices to unlock the full range of their own arias and recitatives.</p>
<p>While developing this workshop, I take on the role of part-time bird carer, guiding the participants through the aviary of the mind. Together, we embark on a mission to decipher the cryptic language of the Imaginary Birds, searching for hidden messages in their melodies.</p>
<p>This workshop blends digital technology with music, harnessing the capabilities of smartphones, computers, MIDI controllers and even the physical presence and movement of the participants as interfaces for musical expression. Reactive and adaptable software processes the participants' inputs, transforming them into bird melodies, like an Imaginary Birds song translator. A grand piano sounds on its own and in response to the presence and movements of the participants. A simple shoebox becomes a birdhouse. Mobile phones become the heart of an interactive audio system, absorbing the soundscape and responding in the language of birdsong.</p>
<p>Duration: 45 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the size and type of working group</p>
<p>Target audience: all ages, but more aimed at children aged 5 to 12.</p>
